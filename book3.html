    <p>
        Those little beauties have inspired so many stories. But where oh where did they get their name from?  
        Why are they called the ladybugs?  
        A tale that tells us emphatically that everything on earth has a purpose to serve.  
        A free children’s book read aloud that is an absolute treat.
